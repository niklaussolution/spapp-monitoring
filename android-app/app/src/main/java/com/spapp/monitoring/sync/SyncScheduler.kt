/**
 * Schedules background sync as a self-chaining OneTimeWorkRequest instead of
 * a PeriodicWorkRequest. PeriodicWorkRequest has a hard 15-minute floor
 * (MIN_PERIODIC_INTERVAL_MILLIS, enforced by WorkManager itself, not just a
 * recommendation — passing a lower value gets silently coerced back up to
 * 15 minutes). A chain of OneTimeWorkRequests, where each run schedules the
 * next one before finishing, has no such floor — this is what lets the
 * worst-case fallback interval be 5 minutes instead of 15, without a
 * foreground service or persistent notification. FCM remains the primary,
 * near-instant path; this chain is only the backstop for when a push
 * doesn't get through.
